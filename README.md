# Copy Puma

You know the drill at this point! The README below bears a _striking_ resemblance to the last one, becuase we'll be copying one of the below sites, just like Copy Cougar, but this time we'll be using CSS Grid instead of Flexbox. Guidelines are the same, and only the framework and sites selected are different; these sites have been specifically curated by grid _experts_ (or, rather, us) to be prime examples to re-implement using CSS Grid.

These are your potential sites to copy:

* [Concentric](https://www.concentric-studio.com/)
* [CEREAL](https://www.readcereal.com/)
* [South](https://www.studiosouth.co.nz/)
* [Biblioteque](http://bibliothequedesign.com/)
* [Jensen Architects](https://jensen-architects.com/)
* [Chopard Diary](https://www.chopard.com/intl/diary/)
* [7Diamonds](https://7diamonds.com/)


### Guidelines

* This is a solo project. You've got this now!
* You _must_ wireframe every single layout, AND you _must_ bring them to an instructor for approval before you can begin.
* You _only_ have to copy the main page, but you _do_ have to copy past the opening viewport. In human speak: you need to copy all the way down to the bottom of the main page.
* We'll be copying every single layout available in the target page. Pay attention to how many layouts were in the original!
* Copy all text verbatim using copy-paste; if it's not selectable, take the equivalent amount of text from a lorem ipsum generator. Do _not_ screenshot it, as an image will respond differently to viewport changes than text will.
* But _do_ save or screenshot images.
* For videos, either link to the original video using a `video` tag, or simply screenshot the video and implement it as a still image.


### Stretch Goals

* Copy another page!
* Repeat.
